### Interactive Chat Functionality
- **Document Querying**: Ask questions about your documents and receive accurate, AI-generated answers. ðŸ†•

### Metadata Consolidation Tools ðŸ”¥
- **Similar Tag Detection**: Find and consolidate similar tags using advanced similarity algorithms.
- **Correspondent Management**: Identify and merge duplicate correspondents to keep your system organized.
- **Document Type Cleanup**: Consolidate similar document types to maintain a clean classification system.

### Automatic Document Summaries ðŸ”¥
