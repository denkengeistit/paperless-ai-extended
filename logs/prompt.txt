Craig Thompsom writes:

"Ted, FYI, see http://www.niiip.org/. NIIIP is an ARPA TRP to do industrial
virtual enterprises. A reference model describes the work. --Cxraig"

NIIIP stands for the National Industrial Information Infrastructure
Protocols. It is partly sponsored by the Technology Reinvestment Program, I
believe at $19M. It is lead by IBM, but has a broad partnership base. The
total commitment is ostensibly $60M.

The AVE Focus Group had a briefing on the program, during our recent
meeting at IBM. I followed this up by a trip to EIT to discuss the program.


Since I know that Art Goldschmidt is involved, it’s a sure bet that the
project is well conceived. Here are some views on how the NIIIP and Metrics
projects differ. I think I know what the project is about, but am willing

to be corrected. And I am especially interested in improving my
understading of what the metrics project should be about.

1). At the most basic level, the projects differ in the role that the
government, as sponsor, plays. The NIIIP project is a Technology
Reinvestment Program project, using conventional ARPA justification. The
government is funding a product-oriented project (plus some "open"
standards); the merit of the project being related to the utility of the
product. TRP requires a dual use justification as well. A distinguishing
feature of these programs (like the Commerce Advanced Technology Program
projects) is that they supplement market forces: funding things that make a
great deal of sense in terms of commercialization, but (in theory) wouldn’t
be funded or would be delayed without government subsidy.

tools and techniques to serve agility. Clearly, no market force will
produce this practical understanding, a "third force” must be introduced.

(Incidentally, it’s my view that government sponsorship of <this> type of
_
effort is more clearly_.a "pure" justification for a government role. To the
extent that the understandings bear directly on defense issues, it is
appropriate for DoD.)

So the impetus for the projects are different, and this probably explains
the different spins I tentatively note below. (There are roughly two orders
of magnitude difference in the funding, but that is leveled somewhat by the
prior EI investment we leverage, as well as the "open" process we note
below.)

2). Both projects address the Virtual Enterprise, both hold
“infrastructure” as a central concept, and both believe object oriented
services will be a key enabler. So at least at this level, there is some
overlap. Note that neither project makes the assumption of other efforts

that OO principles should apply literally in the organization: modular,
resuable, non-hierachical workgroups as a prerequisite fox the VE.

We probably also share a common vision as to who determines the usefulness
of results. It’s clearly market forces here: the users of the
infrastructure tools, etc. But NIIIP will require an organization to change
in some way <and> also adopt new technology as an enabler. We’re chartered
to first provide tools (in the form of metrics) that can used independent
of technology and making few constraints on how the enterprise conducts its
business.


3). One clear difference was worked out at the NIIIP pitch to the AVE Focus
Group. In terms of infrastructure, NIIIP focuses exclusively on the
information infrastructure. The metrics project (lets call it MAVE, then we
can call the AVE participants mavens) instead deliberately looks at
whatever other "infrastructure" issues come to bear on the AVE and look to
the information infrastructure to provide only part of the solution.
Ideally, this would focus on novel solutions to otherwise intransigent

problems, such as legal and cultural issues.

[An example: clearly, legal hugger-mugger is a barrier to more common AVEs.
We can approach the problem bluntly, by looking for "standard" legal
agreements. Or we can use information technology to mitigate the problem:
by, for example creating trusted arbitration agents that deal quickly,
cheaply and early with "legal" issues using commonly agreed upon rules of
arbitration. Ox by lowering the "trust" threshold by empowering, by
technology, an insurance industry to indemnify partners against common
risks of partnering.]

Another difference in focus deals with the enterprise’s life cycle. NIIIP
adopts the "product" lifecycle view that has been popular at Dod.
Therefore, the NITIP infrastructure focuses on the issues associated with
activity of designing and manufacturing a product. MAVE, instead has
specified a larger scope: the life cycle of the VE. This often is triggered
by a product-related opportunity, but as easily could be triggered by some
other type of opportunity or disaster. This difference also was apparent at

the AVE meeting, with the NIIIP representative apparently concurring.

Incidentally, one MAVE assumption mirrors the well-known principle in the
design/mfg arena: that wisdom early in the process is the most
leverageable, and that wisdom comes from forward knowledge of downstream
processes. Therefore MAVE’s focus is in the VE formation stage, likely well
before NIIIP’s product cycie begins.

4). The difference in focus leads to a quite different sense of the need
being addressed. At root, the NIIIP is concerned with <information
sharing>. The product-oriented focus means that the whole project revolves
around a PDES/STEP (Product Data Standards) heritage. MAVE is instead
concerned with <process integration> a whole different set of issues, both
at the unsophisticated user level and at the underlying formal level.
NIIIP is lucky in at least one regard: the processes of interest are
presumed to be well understood. In the MAVE case, until the group started
last year, there was no clear outline of the processes. The group is still

chipping away at some high level boundaries. On the other hand, MAVE has
the luxury of leveraging any exchange token which makes sense. Much of the
thinking coming up will have to consider what the nature of these
transactions are.


5). <How> the work is being conducted is different, and that affects what
is being addressed. NIIIP uses a conventional model. A closed partnership
has been formed with the requisite expertise. The money and requirements go
in; best engineering practice will presumably be employed, but the process
is invisible to the user community at large (and the funders); good results
(I have no doubt) will come out.

MAVE is attempting a more novel approach, with much higher risk. The entire
process is conducted "in public” with the advancement of tentative,
half-baked, and often wrong ideas: brainstorming conducted in regular
meetings; many ad hoc visits (contact me if you’re interested); and
electronic means. The areas that MAVE is addressing have no established
engineering principles, and part of the problem is understanding which

First 3 Laws of Maxwell’s 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership
Assignment


Law #1- Law of the Lid

The Law of the Lid states that your leadership ability determines your success and ability to achieve your goals.
However, people place limits on themselves, a “lid”, that limits their leadership ability and therefore their success. One
example of the Law of the Lid is the success of Steve Jobs when he returned to Apple in the 1990’s. In the 1990’s, Apple
was rapidly losing market share to its competitor’s due to a lack of leadership and a low self-imposed lid. The firm failed
to make products affordable for the everyday consumer, and spent unnecessary resources on projects such as the
Pippen Gaming Console. In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to his role at Apple. He got rid of its unsuccessful experiments, and
in 1998 he introduced the iMac. The iMac, a revolutionary and affordable computer, became an instant success. His
effective leadership and vision led to other successes with affordable products such as the IPod and IPhone. This is a
perfect example of how effective leadership ability and a higher lid lead to greater success for an organization.

https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/04/28/editorial-will-apples-1990s-golden-age-collapse-repeat-itself



Law #2 - Law of Influence

In my personal experiences at Lehigh I have seen the Law of Influence at work. I am a member of the Thompson
Portfolio on campus, a student-run investment portfolio that manages approximately $40,000 in ETF’s. The organization
has a flat structure, with no designated leader of president. However, one member of the group, Alexa, is in a leadership
role because of the influence she has on other members. She is known as an organized, dedicated, and insightful
member of the group who is always willing to go the extra mile. Because of this, other members of the group respect
her and she wields great influence over them. This influence is what allows her to lead our portfolio so effectively. She
runs the weekly meetings, develops our schedule every semester, and makes sure everyone is meeting the proper
deadlines. The ability to effectively influence others in an organization is critical to being a strong leader.



Law #3 – The Law of Process

The law of Process states that in order to be a successful leader one needs to constantly be learning and improving.
Being an effective leader takes time and will not happen overnight. One example of this is Ariana HufÏngton. When she
was creating what would be known as the HufÏngton Post, her leadership style was to be a workaholic and complete
tasks as quickly as possible. She worked seven days a week, and often clocked over 100 hours of work per week. In
addition, she expected a similar amount of dedication from her co-workers. This all came to an end one day in 2007,
when she collapsed from exhaustion. This changed her entire outlook on what it means to be a leader, and importantly,
she learned greatly from this experience. She realized her style of leadership was unsustainable, and became a leader
that emphasized the importance of work-life balance. She now works every day on being a better leader and mentor for
her peers. Being an effective leader takes constant devotion and learning through experience, both of which Ariana
HufÏngton has displayed in her life.

Law #7- Law of Respect
http://thebqb.com/michael-jordan-turns-50-leadership-on-acid-part-6/2217275/

In honor of Michael Jordan’s 50th birthday I think it’s necessary to recognize him as one of the greatest
leaders in the past 50 years. Not only did Jordan bring hope to the entire city of Chicago. Bringing the
city six of the ten possible championships in the 1990’s, MJ took a team that was a clear underdog and
brought them to greatness. Regardless of loyalty, the Bulls became a team that had to be rooted for. His
story is one of a kind. He invested his whole life into doing what he loved in order to be successful. His
legacy carries on and everybody continues to talk about him. With his own Jordan brand, his ownership
of the Charlotte Bobcats, or historic moments, people continue to follow in the greatness of his
footsteps. His life represents not what it takes to be a great leader, but what it takes to be a ridiculously
great leader.

mankind rather than destruction. A great reason as to why he falls in this type of leader category is
because of his acts with the US atomic bomb project. Einstein feared that the National Socialists would
achieve world domination if they developed an atomic weapon first, so he wrote to President Roosevelt
in 1939 urging the US to undertake nuclear research. Along with that, many of his ideas were strange to
ordinary people, however they are of much importance today. Some of these concepts include the
theory of relativity and quantum theory. Not many people are born to be naturally gifted, but Albert
Einstein was definitely born a genius.

Law #9 – Law of Magnetism

Though it is surely a negative example, Adolf Hitler demonstrated a high level of magnetism and
charisma. This murderer was actually appointed by the people of Germany. He was appointed
Chancellor in 1933 and acted as the military and political leader until 1945. Early on, the German’s
believed Hitler presented a flawless revolutionary figure because he could resonate so well with them.
His manner of speaking contributed to the development of a personality cult around him. German
morale was downed after World War I and the Treaty of Versailles ruined the economy. The Fuhrer’s
charisma and interpersonal provided him with the ability to instill hope in the nation. A convincing
figure, he told the German’s that they would become an “imperial and great military power”. He also
was perceived with a great public image because he approved photos or articles the media released
concerning him. The German people were drawn to “Heil Hitler”.

Title: NUMERICAL CONTROL PART PROGRAMMING USING CAD/CAM

Principal Investigators: J. Ochs, and
MT. Ozsoy, Mechanical Engineering and
Mechanics


Discussion:

Numeric Control (NC) part programming is accomplished in
industry in several different ways. The most basic type of part
programming involves writing the process instructions in the
binary coded machine language that is interpreted directly by the
machine tool. For complicated parts, especially those requiring
continuous curvilinear tool paths, this is very laborious. The
Automatically Programmed Tooling (APT) represents the first
attempt to prepare NC part programs using a computer-assisted
part programming language. With this approach, the programmer
must first define the part geometry using the APT definition
Statements and then define the path the tool must follow to
perform the machining operations. In recent years, interactive
computer graphics has been employed to assist in the part
programming task.

There are several ways in which interactive graphics can
make part programming more productive. One way is for the
programmer to read the part drawing and to reconstruct the part
geometry in the computer graphics database. Once this is
accomplished, the tool path can then be defined. The drawback of
this method is that it requires duplication of effort. The
programmer must redefine the part geometry, and this has already
been done by the design engineer during product design. What
makes more sense is to have the design engineer construct the
part definition on a CAD/CAM system during the design process and
incorporate it into the database so that it is available for the
part programmer to use. Clearly, this implies a substantial
productivity improvement over any of the alternative part
programming procedures since the step of defining part geometry
is eliminated.

Once the part definition is completed, the next step is for
the part programmer to create the cutter path. This can be done
either interactively or automatically. When interactive
programming is used, the APT (or other language) statements are
entered into the CAD/CAM system and the action of the tool is
simulated on the graphics monitor immediately. This provides
visual verification of the programmer's instructions, a
significant advantage over conventional computer-assisted part
programming. Automatic part programming means that the tool path
is generated by the CAD/CAM software without the programmer's
assistance. Today's CAD/CAM systems are limited in terms of the
geometries that can be automatically programmed. Typical
geometries for which automatic programming routines are


D3-1
commercially available include profile milling, pocketing and
certain surface contouring operations. .

Ultimately, we anticipate that NC part programming will be
accomplished entirely automatically on the CAD/CAM system by
downloading the design data to the automatic part programming
package for processing to create the completed part program.
This, in turn, will be downloaded directly to the machine tool to
produce the part.

There are several major hurdles to be overcome before part
programming automation can be fully achieved. The limitation of
today’s CAD/CAM part programming software usually necessitates a
combination of the interactive approach and the automatic
approach, Some of the problems that need to be solved deal with
construction of the design database in the proper format so that
it can be readily used by the automatic part programming package.
Another problem area deals with selection of the proper tooling
to perform the particular machining operation. This is done by
the part programmer in current systems. Another problem concerns
the complexity of the part that is to be programmed. The
capability of software to deal with complexities in part geometry
needs to be extended.

This proposed project would address these problem areas
through a collaboration of Lehigh faculty and students together
with personnel from commercial CAD/CAM companies. We have
enjoyed good working relationships with a number of CAD/CAM
vendors for several years. We would undertake to solicit the
active participation of these companies to develop the required
technology base to accomplish fully automated NC part
programming.

Specifically, we propose to identify the problems that need
to be solved to perform part programming automatically--entirely
without the involvement of a human programmer. Next, we propose
to define the approach that needs to be followed in order to
solve these problems. This definition would lead to a set of
projects that could be performed either at the University or at
our partner CAD/CAM companies.

Because of the magnitude and difficulty of this problem, we
anticipate that it would require a long term project spanning
multiple years. We believe that the project could become almost
self-supporting NSF support after the first year because of the
planned CAD/CAM company participation.

Titles; DEVELOPMENT OF A FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM

Principal Investigators: M. Groover, Industrial Engineering;
R. Benner, Mechanical Engineering;
N. Eberhardt, Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering


Discussion:

In today's mechanical manufacturing industries, flexible
manufacturing systems (FMS) represent the highest achievement in
our evolution towards the future automated factory. It stands as
the premier example of flexible automation. The typical FMS
consists of a group of CNC machining stations interconnected by
an automated materials handling system which moves workparts
between machines according to a systematic scheduling algorithm.
All of the activities occurring on the FMS are controlled by a
central computer. Scheduling of parts, operation of the machines
and the materials handling system, and distribution of the part
programs to the various machine tools all are accomplished under
the control of the computer. Automated inspection equipment,
such as coordinate measuring machines, at times also are included
as components in the FMS.

As its name suggests, the FMS is capable of processing a
variety of different part geometries simulataneously under
program control. While one machining station is producing one
part style, other stations are producing other types of parts.
Changes in the production schedule can be made with relative ease
for increased flexibility.

There are a number of problems that remain in the design and
operation of flexible manufacturing systems. Currently, these
Systems are used most economically for mid-volume production
where the annual quantities of parts of one style might number in
the thousands. For truly flexible automation, it should be
possible to produce parts on the system in much lower quantities.
Another problem is in interfacing the different components of the
system both electronically and mechanically. The MAP
Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) proposed by General
Motors should help significantly in solving the electronic data
interface problem. Mechanical problems include connecting the
materials handling system to the machine tools so that workparts
can be accurately registered with respect to the tool axis system
to meet the required product design tolerances. A related
problem that looms
in the future is the problem of interfacing
the FMS to other automated systems in the factory. Production
scheduling and other tactical issues related to system operation
must also be addressed in order for the flexible manufacturing
system to realize its full potential.

We are proposing to design and build
a machining type FMS in


D4-1
the Manufacturing Technology Laboratory at Lehigh University.
The system would consist of a cart-type materials handling
system, three machine tools and a central control computer. The
three machine tools we are planning to use would be a horizontal
machining center, a vertical machining center and a turning
center. This configuration will allow us to machine both
rotational workparts and prismatic (box-like) parts on the same
FMS. An industrial robot would be utilized to interface the
materials handling system to the turning center. The FMS would
be interfaced to an automated guided vehicle system (AGVS) that
would deliver parts from the FMS to other destinations (e.g., the
Robotics Lab).

The control of the flexible manufacturing system would be
accomplished using a central computer connected to our Computer-
Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Lab. We are aiming at the
capability to design parts in either our Computer-Aided Design
Lab or our CIM Lab, and to download the design data through an
automated NC part programming software package to the flexible
machining system to make the parts.

Several of the components of our FMS are already here,
although not yet assembled. We have a Kearney & Trecker 3-axis
horizontal machining center with a General Electric Mark Century
2000 Controller. We have a SI Handling Cartrac (TM) System as
the cart-type materials handling system to interconnect the
machine tools. We are ordering an automated guided vehicle
system for installation in the lab. Components that are missing
include the vertical machining center and the turning center.

We are recommending that a portion of the cost of
engineering the FMS be included as part of the budget in this
proposal. Our pian for the development of the system is to
acquire the remaining pieces of equipment through corporate
donations.

We believe that the proposed flexible manufacturing system
will present a broad variety of research and development problems
for students in the Engineering Research Center to solve over the
next decade. These problems will include software development,
control theory, mechanical and electrical design, communications,
information systems and operations research. We also see this
project as one of the “bridge projects” with the microelectronics
area. Many of the principles involved in the design and
operation of the flexible manufacturing system for machining will
be applicable in other manufacturing industries, such as assembly
and electronics.

Title: Generic Fixturing

Researchers: M. Groover, and
N. Odrey, Industrial Engineering;
R. Benner, Mechanical Engineering


Introduction:

One of the important trends in manufacturing today is toward
greater use of flexible automated systems that can accommodate a
variety of different part styles. Although only several dozen of
these systems have been installed in the United States, it is
anticipated that the number will grow significantly during the
next decade. The flexible manufacturing system (FMS) for
machining operations is the most common example of these
automated systems.

The general goal of flexible systems is to automate the
production of medium and low volumes of product. The features
needed to automate low and medium quantity production are the
following [4]:

1. Capability to operate the production sequence under
program control.

2. Easily programmable, with the possibility for computer-
automation of the programming process, based on existing
product database.

3. Off-line programming.

4, Quick changover of production jobs.

5. Adaptable to a variety of different workpart
configurations.

Features 1, 2, and 3 deal with the control of the system and
the preparation of the control programs. Features 4 and 5 are
concerned more with the mechanics of producing different parts
(or products) on the same production facilities. In the
traditional low or medium volume operation, a setup is required
to changeover the facilities for the next production run,
‘Setting up can be quite time consuming, and no parts are produced
during the setup. Quick changeover of production jobs (Feature
4) means that the setup either is reduced or eliminated
altogether. This would reduce the time lost due to the setup.

The other requirement for producing different parts on the
same production facilities is that the facilities be adaptable to
a variety of different part configurations (Feature 5). In
practice, this means there must be defined limits on the
variability of the parts produced on the system. For example, a


D5-1
flexible manufacturing system that performs machining operations
is limited in terms of the size and shape of the part. Within
these defined limitations, the system must be able to.adapt
readily to the differences in workpart characteristics.



The Proposal:


This proposal is concerned with Features 4 and 5: how can
product changeovers be accomplished quickly, and how can flexible
automated systems be designed to accommodate a variety of product
configurations?


In. the typical operation of a machining type FMS, pallet
fixtures which travel on the computer-controlled materials
handling system are used to deliver parts to the various
machining stations in the specified sequence. At each machining
operation, the part must be properly registered and located at
the machine tool. The pallet fixtures are designed with a common
base that can be moved by the material handling system. The
fixture that is built on the base is designed to clamp and locate
a particular workpart type. The fixture must be located and
fixed to the base with great accuracy. Registration and location
of the part are accomplished by accurately positioning the pallet
fixture in place at the machine tool. The trouble with this
arrangement is that each part type requires a different fixture.
Either the fixture must be permanently mounted on the pallet,
creating a pallet inventory problem when the corresponding parts
are not being produced or time must be spent in fabricating the
fixture for a particular part onto the pallet prior to the
production run, with possible production time losses while the
pallet fixtures are being checked out.


It is proposed that research be undertaken to develop the
engineering design principles for generic fixturing. Generic
fixturing is defined here to mean workholding devices that can be
used to locate and clamp a variety of different workpart
geometries. The term also would include fixtures that could be
adapted easily and quickly to accommodate different parts.
Generic fixtures would be utilized either for single station
setups (i.e., generic fixturing for a CNC machining center) or as
building blocks for pallet fixtures that would be used on a
flexible manufacturing system.


The research would examine the following general areas
.relative to design requirements for generic fixturing:


1. Modular fixtures: The possibility of constructing
fixtures from modular components that could be easily and quickly
assembled is likely to be an important principle of generic
fixturing.


2.
Adaptable to various part configurations: The capability
of the automated system to adapt to various workpart
configurations (Feature 5) must be designed into the fixturing.



D5-2©
; 3. Quick change feature: If the flexible automated system
is to be capable of quick changeover from one product style to
the next (Feature 4), then the fixturing utilized on the system
must also possess this feature.


4, Standardization: Standard components would form the
building blocks of modular fixtures.

5. Compatibility with group technology principles: Today's
flexible manufacturing systems are engineered using the
principles of group technology. Generic fixture design must also
take these principles into account.


6. Part location requirements: How will the fixture locate
the required reference surface(s) for different parts?


7. Clamping: Different part geometries will require
different holding methods, which creates a problem in the design
of generic fixturing.


The problem of designing generic fixtures is one of the
important keys to the successful operation of flexible automated
systems and programmable automated systems. The proposed
research should help to establish some of the fundamental
principles and limitations for such fixtures.

Researchers: M. Groover, and

Introduction:


Project D4 is concerned with the development of a flexible
manufacturing system (FMS). An important component of the FMS is
the materials handling system. Indeed, materials handling is an
important part of most integrated systems of production. We
Propose to establish materials handling as a major thrust area in
Lehigh's Engineering Research Center. The need and applications
for materials handling systems are pervasive in both
microelectronics and mechanical manufacturing processes.


The Center's activities in materials handling will be in
both research and education. Our focus in this proposal deals
with research. The initial work derives from a Ben Franklin
project with SI Handling Systems Inc., a major supplier of
Materials handling systems, This Ben Franklin project is
currently underway. We therefore see this project as a second
year activity.


The project has provided Lehigh with two types of materials
handling hardware: a cart-on-track handling system, and an
automatic guided vehicle system (AGVS). The cart-on-track system
is the handling system used in our FMS in the Manufacturing
Technology Lab, while the AGVS is the system that connects the
FMS with the rest of the factory laboratory.



Proposal:


The proposed research would be concerned with both of the
mechanical handling systems identified above. In addition we
would undertake the problem of using computer interactive
graphics to simulate materials handling systems.


The cart-on-track system is a commercial product for SI, and
no additional research will be done to develop the system
further. However, the problem of interfacing the AGVS to the
cart system, and the advancement of the AGVS technology will be
areas of research in this project.


The mechanical interface problem deals with the transfer of
items from one handling system to the other while maintaining
accuracy of location for processing (e.g., machining on the FMS).
Through proper mechanical design, it should be possible to make
such transfers with high precision. This problem will be

Objective;
The objective of this project is to formulate an on-line hierarchal and distributed closed-loop real-time control methodology   for   flexible  manufacturing   systems.
Background   and   Approach   to   the   Problem:
In a modern manufacturing environment, computers are playing an ever more dominant role. Microprocessors are taking on more and more localized control responsibilities in operational CAM schemes, and a great deal of real-time information is being generated at the shop floor level. It is the intent of this research to tap this wealth of information for on-line, closed-loop production control. The manufacturing environment on which we will focus will be Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS). FMS has the characteristics of a number of machines linked together through both a common computer controller and an automated parts transfer    system.
A first step is to properly organize the data being
generated for analysis. Information modeling is composed of two
major parts: an analytical "front-end," and a representational
"back-end." The analytical front-end is a coherent set of
procedures for finding, identifying and defining entities,
relationship operations that modify the entities and
relationships and data attributes that describe entities and
relationships.	The    representational    back-end    is    a    set    of
procedures for mapping the semantic components of the model onto data structures that represent and describe each component. Since the model of any complex system is likely to be both extensive and subject to revision, it is desirable that the representational   back-end   be   computer   supported.
The intent to date of the proposed research is to devise a suitable computer-based back-end representational support system. One approach to analyzing a complex system is to inquire about the major functions it is intended to perform. The functions so identified may be further divided into sub-functions, sub-functions into sub-functions, and so forth in a hierarchal manner until the level of basic activities is reached. This hierarchical structure may be viewed as having the basic activities nested inside the next higher level of sub-functions, and so forth back up to the highest level. The computer support system as   proposed  should  be   able   to   represent     and  manipulate
Bl-1
such   a   structure   easily.
NIAL (Nested Interactive Array Language) will be investigated as a natural candidate for prototyping this system since the underlying data domain is being considered as a nested arrays of arrays. For example, the nesting of arrays in NIAL terminates in self-nesting arrays which are viewed as atomic (corresponding to activities in i the functional hierarchy). Arrays may be gathered into rectangular arrangements with no restriction on the arrays so gathered (4). When proven, implementation   of   the   system   in   ADA   will   be   considered.
Various methods to obtain shop-floor information have been documented in a practical sense. Our approach is to consider automatic data acquisition and data processing on a real-time basis, modeled and studied as a multi-variate time series. Interrelationships among parameters are captured by cross-covariance functions which may provide important information about the manufacturing system. Of interest is a combined systems modeling and time series analysis approach, and a state-space (or Markovian)' representation provided that the input and output can be expressed in terms of a finite order linear difference equation. As previously noted, NIAL appears to be a natural candidate due to its hierarchal structure and its notation   of   array   theory   as   its   expression   language.
Various authors have developed schematics to illustrate the hierarchy of a manufacturing firm and the interrelationship among its components. Our particular interest and intention is to consider the manufacturing/production systems economics and the associated aggregration problems and performance measures from the operational level up through the intermediate and upper (strategic) levels of the hierarchy. The type of information sampled would be scrap rates, quality measurements, due date slippage, etc., and productivity measurements called managerial control ratios. These ratios suggest that variation in the rate of profit on total investment are related to average product prices, total unit costs, capacity utilization, the productivity of fixed investment and the internal allocation of investment. The key is to gather time series information on process responses to decisions made at all levels of the decision hierarchy.
In the formulation of hierarchial organizational objectives-, various objectives (goals) and constraints occur. One such .objective would be efficient production planning. Hierarchial production planning divides the planning along managerial lines (3) and is the device we shall use to decompose planning problems into more manageable parts. Decisions made at the strategic level represent policy constraints for decisions made at the tactical level, which, in turn, represent policy constraints at the operational level. However, feedback back up the decision hierarchy would be highly desirable once the ramification of those   higher   level   decisions  are   known.
Bl-2
Commensurate with the various analytical techniques that were considered in the previous Air Force report (1), we are considering other techniques which we plan to use and extend in our proposed work. One such technique for studying decomposition of and feedback phenomena in production planning problems is the Lagrangian Relaxation methodology. Also of interest would be a hierarchial structure for the analysis of layout and scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems using an optimal control model (2).
Key to feedback and control is capture of shop floor data about production activities. In this regard, a Shop Floor Information System (SFIS) must be viewed as a generic information system that provides an essential service through a hierarchy of information flow. The basic purposes of an SFIS is to capture and provide accurate, timely raw data for control purposes. The system must have the capability of acquiring the information and providing invisibility as well as feedback instructions from higher   level   systems   (1).
The SFIS in a complex manufacturing environment is the foundation for the hierarchy of control systems which depend upon feedback of accurate, timely raw data. In the short term manufacturing environment, there are many different aspects of the shop which must be controlled: job schedules, operator schedules, quality, etc. In most organizations, responsibility for controlling these functions is not under the same umbrella, yet all require shop floor data and must be coordinated to one degree or another. Other control functions which operate in the longer term, such as ca'pacity and facility planning, also require data   from   the   shop     floor.
We propose to design and evaluate a closed-loop optimal control system to improve productivity of a manufacturing shop floor. The major components of this system are: shop floor information, data processing, controls and decision sub-systems. In the following, several methodologies and mathematical tools are  mentioned   which will   aid   us   in   accomplishing   our   objectives.
The manufacturing shop floor can be viewed as an Input/Process/Output System, which usually contains several inputs and output with certain degrees of interaction among them. Multivariate time series analysis have been used to model relatively complex queuing networks (5). This approach has the potential of on-line implementation and accepting the real time data   from   the   shop   floor   information   sub-system   as   its   input.
The output from data processing is then communicated to the control sub-system. At this point, direttions are made for improving performance measures, and perturbation analysis is to be considered as a candidate for this task. Perturbation analysis is reported to have been successfully used for on-line optimization   of   Flexible   Manufacturing   Systems   (6).
The   control    sub-system   next   feeds   a   manual    (shop      floor
Bl-3
management) or an automated (computerized decision table's) decision sub-system, and at this point decisions are made with regard to the next action or series of actions to be undertaken at  the   shop floor   level.

Computer ScienceandElectrical Engineering
Faculty Associates: Mikell P. Groover, Department of Industrial
Engineering;  Benjamin Litt,  Department of Management, Finance and Marketing
Industrial Participants:  RCA, Princeton, New Jersey Graduate Students:  John C. Chen,  Mustafa Yaseen Disscussion:
Research is needed to understand the nature of the principles underlying the automation and integration of the total manufacturing cycle. An integrated manufacturing system model is proposed, which will be used to evaluate system performance relative to reliability and cost-effectiveness.
Ob jectives:
The total integration of computer-based facilities that support the complete manufacturing process is a necessary condition for increased industrial productivity. System integration on this massive scale is, however, a very complicated problem. The production cycle involves marketing data, product specifications, research into existing products, engineering design, process definitions, preparation for manufacture, manufacturing, maintenance and support. Research is needed to understand the nature of the principles underlying the automation and integration of this complete cycle. We propose to approach this problem by developing an integrated manufacturing system model.     The   specific   objectives   of   the   research   are:
 -	To   establish   the   conceptual   structure   of  a   network  for   the
management     and     transfer     of     knowledge     required     in
manufacturing.
 -	To   build   a   simulation   model   of   the   network.
 -	To   use  the model   to  evaluate   system performance   relative
to   reliability  and   cost-effectiveness.
Background:
The background for the research proposed here consists of five consecutive grants from the National Science Foundation dealing with integrated approaches to knowledge management systems   and   simulation   models.

This body of work led to the development of a model for the online management and transfer of problem-solving knowledge of the type characteristic of a manufacturing environment. A question-analyzing procedure was implemented which functions with a technique for regenerating information to provide a start toward    genuine    knowledge    integration    and    transfer    (1).
In addition, a simulation model of the MEDLINE online information system of the National Library of Medicine was developed. Alternative configurations for distributed processing systems were modeled and tested for cost and performance projections (2). The modeling procedures are directly applicable to  the  manufacturing   environment   contemplated   in   this   proposal.
Approach:
The requirements of an integrated manufacturing system will first be analyzed- We plan to incorporate these requirements as system features as follows:
(a)  Dynamic subsystem definition
Subsystems will not be locked into a rigid configuration, but will, instead, be defined around the functional requirements of flexible manufacturing. Each subsystem will be defined by:
 -	A subset of operational functions
 -	A pattern of information flows
 -	Well-defined software components
 -	A collection of databases
B2-2
(b)	Communicating analytical , operating and control systems
The network will have three kinds of processing activities, namely:
 -	Information processing
 -	Decision processing
 -	Network processing
iill_2.£.iJLa.^.i_o-J2. 2.ISL££.lL£.i.IL&. refers to the generation, transformation, and interpretation of the information needed for   the   operation   and   support   of   manufacturing   functions.
Decision processing deals with the recognition of problems, the formulation and testing of alternative solutions, and the   choice   of   a   solution.
Ne twor k £r_££^s_^_i_iij^ will be accomplished by a number of processors distributed over the network, controlling communications   and   information   flows   at   subsystem   interfaces.
(c)	A_  common   database
The database will include:
 -	A set of databases at the level of individual data
elements
 -	Answer-delivery software
 -	Problem-recognition software
 -	Unified database access software
 -	Query-response software
 -	A set of information access controllers to control
interactions between answer-delivery software and database
accesses.
A preliminary simulation model of the network will then be constructed. The Q-CERT and SLAM languages are both available on the CYBER 170/730 at Lehigh.
The performance of a hypothesized integrated manufacturing system will then be simulated by varying appropriate parameters of the model. These include costs, volumes of data flows, the behavior of servers and queues, data transmissions between individual subsystems, the volume and frequency of database accesses, communications within and between networks, etc. These model results will be used to establish preliminary estimates of the likelihood of achieving large-acale integration.

Abstract:
Any given manufacturing environment can be characterized by a collection of cooperating processes designed to complete a well defined task. By applying the principles of computer networks and structured software design to an automated manufacturing environment, the overall system can be greatly enhanced and improved. This paper discusses an overall strategy towards this goal, and describes some of the basic design considerations which should  be   followed.
Description:
Robots and robotic controllers are now much more complex and are able to perform what would have been considered advanced computing processes just a few years ago. In any given manufacturing environment there is often a collection of more than one robot, along with several research and administrative computers. The need to integrate computing systems has been recognized for several years now, and with the advent of large scale   robotic   systems   the   need   is   often  more   apparent.
Imagine   the   following   scenario:
An engineer designs a part using a "state of the art" CAD-CAM system. When finished with the design process, the entire part is fully described by the mathematical relationships contained in the computing system. At this point, the designer must have a program written for a robot or some other numerical control tool (or tools) to create the part. Unfortunately, the plans for the part must be off-loaded from the original computer, loaded to another computer, translated to some other format, and then the program may begin to be developed, using only a fraction of the information which was originally entered by the designing engineer   in   the   first   place.
By applying a proper networking scheme, using a special purpose language and operating system, the process of moving tasks (or jobs) from one special purpose, but dedicated, system to another may be greatly simplified and streamlined. In fact, by applying good design methods from the very beginning, the entire    translation   process    could    be    eliminated    because    the
B3-1
cooperating computers in an environment would be aware enough "of each other so that a better level of compatibility could be achieved.
System  Goals:
 -	An   efficient   protocol   and   hardware   scheme   for   the   simple
connection    of    several    local    computer   systems■(including
intelligent   robots).
 -	An   efficient   and   simple   software   system   to   facilitate   the
ease    of    transferral    of    information    and    programs    among    the
cooperating   computers   on   the   network.
 -	A simple and   straightforward   way  of   adding   systems   (new
computer   systems  a nd   new software applications)  to   the  network
once   the   system  is   functioning   and   in   place,   i.e.,   expandability.
- A system which will be as easy to implement as possible and simple to maintain. This goal is necessary so that designers and manufacturers of robotic and manufacturing systems would be willing to   produce   compatible   systems   in   the   future.
Design  Problems:
-	There  is  in  use  currently a multitude of  different  types
of  hardware   and   software.     In   fact,    even   single   manufacturing
environments   often   employ   varying   types   of  hardware and   software.
To accommodate   and  connect   all   such   systems will   be  difficult   and
time   consuming.
-	At    present,    much   work   is    being   done   in    the    field   of
networking and   distributed processing,   so   it   will   be   necessary  to
keep   abreast   (if   not   one   step  ahead)   of   the   current   technology  as
it   changes.
Implementation   Details:
It. would seem logical that a highly structured and layered system must be devised which would incorporate easy to implement standards   and   features.
I propose that a very simple but flexible set of operating system primitives first be devised which could be easily implemented on a wide variety of hardware. With this feature, the major systems could be easily connected in a very tightly coupled   fashion.
Once the initial operating system layer (which by definition would include the basic networking layer) is designed, implemented and tested, the fundamental language layers could be added. Several special purpose languages should be developed to handle all the basic tasks of design and execution in a manufacturing environment. Although these languages would be special   purpose   in   the   sense   that   they  are designed  for   a   very
B3-2
specific task (such as drafting, robot program development, etc.). it is of the utmost importance that a basic commonality be maintained to satisfy the initial requirements of the proposal — that communication among the different tasks be as clean and efficient as possible, including tasks which are on different computers. This concept in software is only just beginning to be explored and implemented in small scale integrated software packages   for   microcomputers,   such   as   LOTUS   1-2-3.

Background:
Currently there is a strong participation of industry and standards organizations to define an acceptable Open System Interconnect. This local area network is designated MAP standing for Manufacturing Automation Protocol and originated in 1982 by a task force within General Motors Corporation. The network is a baseboard token passing seven layer protocol. Portions were demonstrated in March of 1984 at the National Computer Conference. The interconnection of six different computer vendors equipment showed successful passage of a limited number of   messages   and   files.
On September 11th and 12th, McDonnel1-Douglas together with General Motors co-hosted the third ad hoc workshop in Detroit, regarding the MAP protocol progress. More than two hundred companies were represented by more than 400 participants. Votes were taken and unanimous approval was made to pursue this protocol development. The next session was tentatively scheduled for the National Bureau of Standards in the Washington, D.C. area in   January   of   1985.
The MAP protocol represents a major step forward in controlling the shop floor of the future. It does not encompass the tim-e critical real-time aspects of factory automation. A tentative inclusion of some of the developing PROWAY Standards may be a solution to the real-time problems which the MAP protocol does not address. Another solution may be to establish a lower level dedicated local area network which then communicates   with   the  MAP  local   area   network.
Objectives;
Communications network techniques, which have become stabilized, primarily have been used for the high volume-low response requirement data transfers. These techniques are not satisfactory for the low volume high response requirements of many real-time processes. This is where we wish to place our effort.      to   be   specific,    our   research   objectives   are:
B4-1
 a)	To   devise   a   sub-network which   is   responsive   to   real­
time   requirements   of   discrete   processes;
 b)	To   integrate   such  a   sub-network   with   existing   or   future
higher   level   networks;
 c)	To   participate   and   remain  abreast   of   standardization
efforts   regarding   factory   automation   protocols.
Approach ;
Lehigh University has great interest in pursuing academic research and instruction regarding network problems as well as practical considerations for providing in-house networks to tie together its many factory automation laboratories. Lehigh also has an excellent proving grounds to demonstrate the total Computer   Integrated  Manufacturing   for   the   Factory   of   the   Future.
Currently, Lehigh is assembling, in one building, a variety of laboratories which include: A robotic manufacturing work cell; computer numerically controlled machining center; computer controlled horizontal transportation system; computer aided design and computer aided manu

Law #4- The Law of Navigation
http://ourmilitaryheroes.defense.gov/profiles/luttrellM.html
A great example of the “The Law of Navigation” is Marcus Luttrell’s heroic combat efforts
when him and three other SEALs were outnumbered 25:1 in the hills of Afghanistan on June
28th, 2005. The SEALs were so well prepared for combat through grueling training that they
withstood the deadly assault by the enemy for hours. Unfortunately, a Chinook helicopter
that came to their rescue was shot down by the Taliban and 16 Navy SEALs were killed.
Marcuss Lutrell and his platoon kept fighting after that failed rescue attempt but Marus
was ultimately the only survivor of that harsh combat. Because he had a clear vision of
what his platoon needed to do to survive, he got them out of harms way for a miracle
amount of time. Marcus had previously mapped out in his head an escape route, expected
the worst on his mission, and adjusted his priorities effectively during the Taliban assault.
This is why Marcus became the lone survivor, kept his team alive for as long as he could,
and became a national hero.

Law #2 – The Law of Addition
The first person that comes to mind as an example of “The Law of Addition” is my father.
My grandmother raised my dad and 4 other children as a single mother. He learned hard
work and persistence from his mother after seeing her work multiple jobs while still being
able to raise 4 children and put them through private high schools. My dad has shaped me
into the person I am today by setting a good example and listening and leading me when I
need help. My dad is a great example of a leader because he also prioritizes more effectively
than anyone else I’ve ever met. He wakes up every morning at 4:30am to workout and read,
completes a full day of work, then gets come to cook and spend time with his family. My
father sets a great example for me just through his day-to-day routine. My father has made
himself valuable to myself and my brother and sister, and almost always puts the
importance of caring and providing for his family over everything else in his life.

Law #3 – The Law of Solid Ground
http://www.workplacecommunicationexpert.com/champion-leadership-tip-16-tips-from-
herb-brooks-the-man-who-led-the-1980-miracle-on-ice/
Herb Brooks demonstrated “The Law of Solid Ground” through his coaching of the 1980 USA
Men’s Olympic gold medal hockey team. Herb showed through his tough character and
competence that being a successful leader takes a lot of work, but work he was willing to
put in for his team. Herb created and communicated his goal of winning a gold medal, and
his team put in grueling hours on the ice because they trusted and believed in his vision and
truthful character. It took a while for his team to develop deep trust in him because of his
firm characteristics, but Herb had trust in his players all along. All of the players on the
1980 Olympic team learned how to be successful leaders because of the way Herb taught
through example.

Financial: The annual audit is underway by Ray, Mesch and Company, the complete audit report will be available after March 1, 1980.
Annual member payments for membership and projects are coming in slowly.
Two surveys to be delivered to members in February are:
 (1)	Visit Report on Europe, North America and Japan Tour
by Ron Evans, Swinburne College of Technology,
Australia.
 (2)	CAD/CAM Survey of Australian Manufacturing Industry
by Ron Evans and James K. Russell, Swinburne College
of Technology, Australia.
Several surveys were initiated in January in the U. S. Region that will result in a:
 (1)	Profile of a CAM-I company operations
 (2)	Profile of a CAM-I participant
 (3)	Profile of trade journal readership of participants
 (4)	Profile of 180 press services to determine those
interested in CAD/CAM
(5)	Profile of CAM-I Educational Member participants
The CAM-I Management Prospectus was revised after the results of an October member opinion survey were tabulated. A new section entitled, "CAM-I Operations" was added. 2600 copies of the new CAM-I Management Prospectus have been mailed to all U.S. Management and Technical Representatives for in-house distribution. This was done to broaden our member companies' knowledge of CAM-I, its activities and accomplishments.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS: WALTER 1.. ABEL, PRESIDENT
 
 •	The Executive Committee of the Board of
Directors of CAM-I met in Boston on
January 5, 1981.
 •	Our thanks to Systems Engineering Laboratories,
Inc. who offered to make available to CAM-I a
Systems 3277/80 computer system with attractive
terms.  The Executive Committee believes that
the availability of an in-house computer would
be helpful in the conduct of administrative and
business activities with future use as needed for
the testing, evaluation, and demonstration of
CAM-I project output.  Accounting, labor reporting,
word processing, membership records, library
accounting and management, and technical and
business activity planning are the areas intended
for use of the computer.
The system should be installed by mid-May, 1981.

CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION AND MARKETING: C. H. "PETE" LINK, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND, GENERAL .MANAGER. .,
  Twenty-six persons attended the Factory Automation Seminar held January 27-29, 1981, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  The basic overview of factory automation addressed general issues senior level corporate leaders face in automation and together we discovered that there are three levels of training needed for CAD/CAM.  They are:
 1.	Direct users (very technical);
 2.	Managers (need to know how to plan, organize,
Implement, monitor and evaluate CAD/CAM programs); and
3.	Corporate level (policymaking in general).

 •	The next Board of Directors meeting will be August 25, 1980
in Dallas, Texas
s Mr. Acker visited CAM-I's Japanese members in May to discuss communication and member requirements. He will report his findings to the Board at its August 25, 1980 meeting.
■ • • • •
 •	Mr. George Armstrong, Senior Vice President of Caterpillar
Tractor, and a Director of CAM-I, along with his associate,
Mr. Ray Adams, visited with the staff in Arlington for a day.
The CAM-I staff appreciated the time he took to visit.
 •	Mr. Link gave presentations to the corporate division meetings
of Harris Corporation in Melbourne, Florida and the DuPont
Company of Wilmington, Delaware recently. Nineteen divisional
representatives were present at the Harris Corporation meeting.
Mr. Joe Trotta, Market Manager CAD/CAM Systems, Systems
Engineering Laboratories, also spoke before the Harris group.
His subject was "A Member's Viewpoint of CAM-I and its
Benefits". Thanks, Joe!
Mr. Link visited Messrs. Jim Hill, Vice President Products, Services (and CAM-I Director) and Jess Barker, Vice President of Marketing, and others at Systems Engineering Laboratories offices following the Harris presentation.
•	The U. S. member profile study is nearing completion. Profiles
were developed by industry group, Project and Committee group,
and Management and Technical Representatives - both active
(in Projects and/or Committees) and inactive (attend annual meetings only).
The profile of active versus inactive points out significant differences. One difference is that the inactive representative's need is for "a better understanding of CAD and CAM developments in other companies" while the active representative's need is "interchange with other companies". Most other needs differ also.
The study contains 46 matrices comparing profiles for education, age, CAD experience, CAM experience, years with current employer, position in company, years in current position, area of responsibility, manufacturing product type, service product type, individual participation benefits, company member benefits, professional association memberships, media readership, and future project recommendations.
Mr. Link is completing profile summaries and expects the survey report to be published by August.

Law of the Lid

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kravis

The Law of the Lid can be seen in businesses and organizations. I think the most predominant
area it is seen is in the private equity industry. Private equity companies will finance an acquisition of a
company they think is being mismanaged or can produce a good return. The “lid” of the company is the
current management and direction, so companies like KKR will buy out a company and implement new
management or structure. This most popular example is probably the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco,
which is what the book and movie The Barbarians at the Gate is based on. Henry Kravis, who was one of
the founding members of KKR, bought out RJR Nabisco for $31.4billion in 1987, which was the highest
price ever paid for a commercial enterprise at the time. By taking control of the company, he was able to
take the “lid” off and take the company in a different direction.



Law of Influence

http://time.com/4301820/caitlyn-jenner-2016-time-100/

Caitlyn Jenner is a very influential person today. She is seen by many as a shining example of
having the courage to be yourself. She won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics and was a positive role
model for the nation and a hero to many. Thirty years later, she has the courage to come out and have a
sex change – which many see as an even more courageous act. In a time where coming out is gaining
momentum and being yourself is becoming more and more the norm, this was a pivotal moment that
can help lead this frontier in progressive thinking.



Law of Process

The Marine Corps in a great example of the law of process. They are dedicated to producing
leaders and a process that begins builds leadership from the start. Someone doesn’t start as a marine,
they work up to that stature through everyday hard work and complete dedication. The law of process
states that “leadership develops daily, not in a day” and this is a prime example of this.

Law #4- The Law of Navigation

http://www.the-happy-manager.com/articles/characteristic-of-leadership/

Tom Watson Jr., CEO of IBM between 1956 and 1971, was a key figure in the information revolution. Watson
repeatedly demonstrated his abilities as a leader, never more so than in his story. A young executive had made some
bad decisions that cost the company several million dollars. He was summoned to Watson’s ofÏce, fully expecting to be
dismissed. As he entered the ofÏce, the young executive said, “I suppose after that set of mistakes you will want to fire
me.” Watson was said to have replied, “Not at all, young man, we have just spent a couple of million dollars educating you.”
This story provides a strong message of support and a reminder that some of the most powerful lessons we can learn
are from our so-called failures or difÏcult times. Remember Edison’s famous saying: “I have not failed. I’ve just found
10,000 ways that won’t work.” Thomas Edison also demonstrated a great response to adversity which compliments
Watson Jr’s actions. When his factory was burned down, with much of his life’s work inside, Edison said: “There is great
value in disaster. All our mistakes are burned up. Thank God we can start anew. A characteristic of leadership is to see
things differently. Seeing mistakes as an investment in learning. Seeing that, even in disaster, we can start anew.



Law #5 - The Law of Addition

When I was a undergraduate, I was first selected to participate in a task group. Group members were basically

PHD or master's degree, I was the only undergraduate, so every time what I can do was very limited.
Many of the experiments made me very confused, I went to my professor for help He said if you help other people get
what they want, those people will help you get what you want. And with that simple, yet powerful, statement, my life
was changed. Up until that moment, I was a leader who was constantly looking for people to help me. All of a sudden,
my professor helped me understand that, as a leader, I had it turned upside down. I needed to turn it completely around
so that my goal was to help people. The most helpful way we do this is to actually get to know the people we are
leading, find out their priorities, goals, hopes, and dreams, and then figure out what we can do to assist them in getÝng
where they need to go.



Law #6 – The Law of Solid Ground

A perfect example of the Law of Solid Ground that I have seen firsthand is my collage football experience. I was
the head wide receiver in the team, and our Quarterback was the captain. We were the best partners on the ground at
that time. When I was sophomore year, my partner graduated, with a lot of victory and honor, and I became the new
captain. But there were always a lot of mistakes when we were training. At the beginning, we all did not care, just think
more practice would be fine. But a few weeks later, the team's running did not go well. We had a meeting together,
everybody said the idea of the problem. We need more trust. We should believe the new quarterback, just like I believe
the old captain before. No matter how the new quarterback passed the ball, I did my best to run the path. After a few
training, the new quarterback increasingly confident, pass the ball more and more precise. Our team replied the high
momentum. Trust is the foundation for all effective leadership. When it comes to leadership, there are no shortcuts.
Building trust requires competence, connection and character.

China has been seeing a rapid economic booming since 1978 and has become
the world second largest economic entity years ago while China’s economy was
failing and collapsing in the 1970’s. These incredible and dramatic change is
called Chinese economy reform, which is led by Deng Xiaoping who is the leader
of China during that period. Because Deng was able to lead China by the Law of
Navigation, he and his reformist allies were success. Not only did Deng give a
good vision to everyone, but also he charted the course. Just as the book say,
“They see the whole trip in their minds before they leave the dock,” Deng had
carefully considered every possible aspect of the reform and draw on past
experience. Deng examined the conditions first and realized that agriculture
problem was the priority. China was suffered from a tragic famine in 1959 and
Deng’s first step, therefore, began in agriculture. After successfully increasing
agriculture production, Deng adopted the socialist market economy, which is a
very brave step. Although the opposition and resistant was extremely strong,
Deng had painstakingly planned every specific step and showed his confidence
and determination to his allies and his followers. Although there was a stunning
failure in 1989, Deng learned from it and recovered from it in a short time. And
finally, as we all know, Deng was success and his reform did salvage China’s
economy. By charting the course, Deng is successful by the Law of Navigation.


2) The Law of Addition
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln
Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States who led the
United States through its Civil War—its bloodiest war and its greatest moral,
constitutional, and political crisis. In doing so, he preserved the Union, abolished
slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy. As
one of the greatest president in America, Lincoln was lived by the Law of
Addition by adding value to others and changing lives. The book says that “when
a person moves into a position of authority, he or she gives up the right to abuse
people.” As for Lincoln, he did far more than this. Lincoln began to speak out
against the expansion of slavery in 1858 while taking part in a debate. Although
he lost the U.S. Senate race because of his words, he insists on truly valuing
blacks and adding value to them. Beginning with the Emancipation Proclamation,
Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the Border
States to outlaw slavery, and eventually permanently abandoned slavery
throughout the whole country. According to Lincoln’s work which adopts the
Law of Addition, not only did he advance black people, but also he advanced the
united country.


3) The Law of Solid Ground
When I firstly become the president of CSSA, I had built a little bit trust in
the club which is far not enough for me to efficiently lead the club. I soon
realized how important the trust was. Without the trust, I had to take so much
effort to only achieve a tiny goal. I asked my colleagues to arrive on time when
we hold a board meeting. However, I hadn’t have their trusts since I used to be
late for the meeting when I was vice president. Therefore, a meeting which was
interrupted a couple of times by people’s lateness was so inefficient that it lasted
much longer than I expected even if I tried hard to stick to the agenda. However,
this situation has changed after a couple of meeting because I always arrived on
time or even fifteen minutes earlier and has never been late again. I believe they
saw my consistency of keeping arriving on time and they trusted me. After I
successfully hold the 150 students’ airport pickup activity and 100 students’ BBQ
which are two the most important activities our club hosts annually, I felt that I
have gained all their trust. And later when I made some major decisions such as
discontinued the Chinese prom which used to be held once a year, my colleagues
all agreed with me and trusted my decisions. This is the effect of the Law of Solid
Ground.

Summary Sheet

Beginning in the 1970’s, researches started investigating gender differences in leadership.
Investigations into leadership style have revealed that women are more likely to use democratic
and transformational styles than men are. Research looking at leadership effectiveness indicates
a slight disadvantage for women in masculine domains, a slight effectiveness advantage for
women in feminine domains, and a greater use by women of effective transformational and
contingent reward behaviors.

Women are significantly underrepresented in major leadership positions. The barriers
women encounter on their leadership journey have been dubbed the leadership labyrinth.
Removing these barriers will help ensure equal opportunity, access to the greatest talent pool,
and diversity, which have been linked to organizational success. There are a number of
explanations for the leadership gender gap. One set of explanations focuses on women’s lack of
human capital investment in education, training and work experience. There is no empirical
support for the argument that women are less educated than men are or that they are more likely
to quit their jobs or choose the mommy track. There is evidence that women assume significantly
more domestic responsibility, which contributes to less work experience and more career
interruptions. Additionally, women receive less formal training and have fewer developmental
opportunities at work than men.

Another set of explanations for the gender gap focuses on differences between men and
women. Women are no less effective at leadership, committed to their work, or motivated to
attain leadership roles than men. However, women are less likely to self-promote than men are,
and they are less likely to initiate negotiation, an important tool all leaders need in order to
access the right opportunities and resources both in the professional and domestic spheres.
Finally, although there are some traits differences between men and women, they equally
advantage men and women in leadership.

The prejudice explanation for the leadership gap is strongly supported. Gender
stereotypes of women as communal and men as agentic are particularly damaging to women in
leadership. The incongruity between the female gender role and the leadership role leads to
prejudice against female leaders, who are evaluated and perceived more negatively than their
male counterparts. These biases are particularly detrimental during unstructured decision-making
processes that often occur when elite leaders are selected. Gender-biased leader stereotypes can
threaten women eliciting either vulnerability or a reactance response. There is evidence that this
discrepancy is on the decline as the leader role becomes more androgynous and women become
more agentic.

Finally, there are a number of approaches to navigating the labyrinth. Significant
organizational reform will make it easier for women to reach top positions – including changes
in workplace norms, changes in organizational culture, increases in career development for
women, increases in effective mentoring opportunities, and women taking more strategic
positions leading to high leadership roles. Effective negotiations will help decrease the gender
gap, especially negotiations regarding role expectations at work and at home. Additionally, the
combination of warmth with agentic qualities and in particular the melding of individualized
consideration with inspirational motivation can be effective for developing female leaders.

Chapter 4. Developing a Mission, Vision, Goals, and Objectives for the Project
Chapter 4. Developing a Mission, Vision, Goals, and Objectives for the Project

I. Start by defining the problem.

A. A problem is a gap between where you are and where you want to be, with

obstacles existing that prevent easy movement to close the gap.

B. The problem statement does not necessarily have to be very detailed, but has to

define exactly what the idea of the project is.

C. In our case, the project definition can qualify for the problem statement.

II. Define Vision and Mission

Advanced Perspective

Project Objective Statement (POS) – A good way to help define the problem, vision
and mission.
a) Establishes a project’s scope, schedule and resources while helping to lead to
more in-depth mission and vision statements.
b) Composed of 25 or fewer words (this restriction forces precision)
c) Uses plain language, avoiding jargon and acronyms.
d) It is clear and concise.
e) Ideally, it is visionary, creating a challenge and generating excitement.
f) Ex: Apollo Mission: “Put a man on the moon and return him safely by
December 31, 1969, at a cost of $9B” (HBR, “Project Management Manual”,
12).
(ref. Harvard Business Review: Project Managers Manual. )
A. The vision is what the customer wants and needs from the end results. Can be
considered what the final result will “look like”.
B. The mission of the project is to achieve the vision and can be written by
answering two questions.
1. What are we going to do?
2. For whom are we going to do it?
C. Page 47 – Figure 4-1 Mission, Vision, Problem Diagram

III. Developing project objectives. – it is a statement of what result is to be achieved
A. From the mission statement, define a set of objectives.
B. Each objective is achieved by performing a series of tasks.

C. Each objective must be SMART.
1. Specific

2. Measurable

3. Attainable

5. Time-limited

D. Good way to determine a good objective is to answer the following two
questions:
1. What is our desired outcome? – helps focus on results
2. How will we know when we achieve it? – establishes exit criteria

IV. Assessing project risks.
A. Risk analysis should ask, “What could go wrong?” in hope that the answers
may help you avert some of the risks.
B. Don’t identify every possible risk, but instead just the more likely ones.
C. It is helpful to assess the risks of failure of the following.
1. The schedule.
2. The budget.
3. Product quality.
4. Customer satisfaction.

Advanced Perspective

Questions to be asked while assessing risks:
a) Have risks been identified?
b) Have they been prioritized?
c) Have actions been taken to reduce the probability of risk?
d) Have contingency plans been formulated?
e) Who is responsible for managing risk?

The Law of Respect
Don Draper from Mad Men is the epitome of the law of respect. He is a high up
executive and part owner at an advertising agency in the 1960’s. When he walks into the
room people sense he is the leader. When he decides something it is final and has sound
and irrefutable arguments. He is willing to go alone and choose the unpopular route
when he knows it is the right thing to do.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men

The Law of Intuition
Sir Alex Ferguson was the manager of Manchester United FC for 26 years, winning 38
trophies in that time. His intuition leadership was displayed by his uncanny ability to
choose the right team for each game as well as decide when and who the right
substitutions were for each situation. His ability to manage the chemistry and
personalities were unmatched, and resulted in the huge success of his team.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson

The Law of Magnetism

A good example of this is not a single person, but a fraternity or sorority as a whole. It is
often the case that a greek organization is made up of very similar people, and that is
due to many cases of the law of magnetism. If you like the same things, and participate
in the same activities as someone else, it is likely you will consider them a friend and
join the same organization as them. This is why greek organizations often have a
stereotype. It is because they usually are similar in many ways and they can be
categorized into stereotypes.

Maxwell Writing Assignment #1
Matt Kosik

Law #1: The Law of the Lid
The Law of the Lid states that leadership ability determines a person’s level of
effectiveness. I believe there is no better example of this than Lee Iacocca. Chrysler
Corporation was doing well in the 1960’s until things took a turn for the worse. At this
point in time the company looked to various corporate presidents such as Lynn
Townsend and John Riccardo who continually let the company down. Townsend
believed that “anyone could do any job, regardless of expertise or experience” and
Riccardo attempted to cut as many costs as possible instead of leading. Lee Iacocca
came along and rebuilt the company from the ground up and became a public figure
appearing in famous advertisements. Iacocca had the leadership capacity to save
Chrysler and become the most effective CEO it has ever had.
<Riding the roller coaster: a history of the Chrysler Corporation
By Charles K. Hyde, Google Books>

Law #2: The Law of Influence
The Law of Influence States that the true measure of leadership is influence – nothing
more, nothing less. Maxwell goes on to say that influence is all about character,
relationships, knowledge, intuition, experience, past success, and ability. The person I
think exemplifies almost all these qualities is famous soccer coach, José Mourinho.
Mourinho has been successful with every professional team he has coached.
Professional soccer coaches are known to move around almost as much as the players.
Success has followed Mourinho wherever he has gone, leading the past 4 teams he has
coached to European Championships. He is on an unbelievable 147 game home-
unbeaten streak that lasts over 4 teams and 9 years. He’s regarded as one of the best
coaches and motivators of all time and clearly has been able to influence his teams.
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho>

Law #3: The Law of Process
The Law of Process states that leadership develops daily, not in a day. Even with all his
controversies, I believe Tiger Woods is a great example of the Law of Process at work.
He is easily considered one of the best golfers of all time and can attribute most of his
success to the years and years of practice he has put in. Tiger’s practice routine can be
found on his website <http://web.tigerwoods.com/fitness/tigerDailyRoutine>
He practices from 6:30 am to 7 pm. Everyday with only a half hour break of breakfast
and lunch. He continually works to improve every aspect of his game whereas his other
competitors usually dedicate most of their time to their weaknesses. Like him or not,
Tiger exemplifies the law of process perfectly.

Il. TEACHING

Summary of Accomplishments

I was originally attracted to Lehigh in great measure by what I perceived to be a
well balanced emphasis on teaching and research Active involvement in the education
of students has been, and continues to be, of fundamental importance to me in my
career at Lehigh I consider it to be a great honor that my efforts were recognized by
the Industrial Engineering Department’s “Outstanding Teaching Award” this year.
This is only the second year the award has been given, and is based on a vote of
department juniors and seniors

At the graduate level, I have focused on building a strong program in the area of
Industrial Statistics I have completely revised existing courses in Product Quality (IE
332) and Design of Experiments (IE 410), and have developed new courses in Advanced
Quality Control Methods (IE 405) and in Time Series Analysis (IE 409) I have been
gratified by the relatively large enrollments, and by the increasing number of students
from other departments who populate these courses These courses seem to have
stimulated research interests in many graduate students, both in Industrial Engineering
and other departments, resulting in an active role as advisor and committee member
At the undergraduate level, my primary teaching responsibility has been in the
atea of Operations Research The challenge has been to stimulate the interest and
creative thinking of the students in these analytical (and historically dreaded) courses.
I believe I have been successful in this endeavor as witnessed by the aforementioned
teaching award. I am also gratified that several of our undergraduates have gone on to
study Operations Research in graduate school

I have also been active at the freshman level, having served as a freshman
advisor for the past three years, served on the Engineering 001 oversight committee,
delivered an Engineering 001 departmental problem presentation, and participated
regularly in Candidates Day.

Additional accomplishments include my service as faculty advisor to the Lehigh
chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, the receipt of a course development
grant from the provost’s office, active involvement on IE council, and a recent
appointment to the College’s Academic Policy Committee.

1 Winner of the Industrial Engineering Department Outstanding Teaching Award for
1991-1992. A vote of IE department juniors and seniors determines the winner.

With G Wilson, S.D, Wu, and L Burke, I have provided 10 undergraduates a one
credit research opportunity on our Bethlehem Police Department Manpower
Scheduling Project
. With L Burke, have provided research experience for an undergraduate, Charlene
Achey, who works on our Chrysler Challenge Fund Grant.

Delivered the IE Departmental Engineering 001 problem presentation 1991

. Was awarded a Provost’s office grant ($1500) for course development which was
used to develop a simulation game to aid in teaching quality control decision
making in IE 332
Til. RESEARCH

My research interest is the application of Statistics and Operations Research to
industrially relevant problems I have worked in three principal areas, probabilistic
algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, statistical process control, and
statistical modeling of industrial processes. Regardless of the specific industrial
application, my research is bound by two fundamental principles: the integration of
statistical and first principles models for improved process optimization and control,
and a desire to investigate problems of industrial relevance

In the area of Production Systems, I have been actively involved in the
development of probabilistic algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems,
principally in scheduling and routing Recently, this research has been extended to the
study of problems arising in the design of VLS integrated circuits These techniques
combine problem-specific knowledge with randomized search strategies to develop
heuristics which are both powerful, and robust to varying industrial settings With my
colleague David Wu, several papers have been published, and grant proposals
submitted Funding for graduate student researchers has been provided through grants
from the CMSE and ATLSS Professor Wu and myself also received a grant from
Unisys to investigate software development using a manufacturing systems approach.

In the area of statistical process control, I have been active in interdisciplinary
research with Professor Christos Georgakis through the Center for Process Modeling and
Control. I serve as Research Area Leader for one of the four thrust areas of the center;
“Statistical Engineering Process Control”. This research combines statistical and first
principles models of chemical processes to provide improved process quality This
project is ongoing, and supports two graduate students each year. Additionally, my
work in this area has been recognized in each of the past two years by the Exxon
Education Foundation through unrestricted awards. Research with one of my Ph D
students, Jose Macedo, falls in this same thrust area His ATLSS supported
dissertation, “Active Reduction of Location Uncertainty in Large Scale Robots”,
involves a physically different process, but shares many commonalities in theory In
this work, statistical and dynamic models were used to devise “active sensors” which
adapt to conditions so as to optimize the rate of information acquisition

In the applied statistics area, I have collaborated with Professor
Sathyanarayanan and his students in the study of grinding processes in manufacturing.
This research involves experimental design, data analysis, and empirical modeling of
these processes. Additionally, Professor Laura Burke and I received a grant from
Chrysler for experimentation and empirical modeling in the area of driving comfort, a
project which is presently under way

THE LAW OF THE LID

I had with a student with high leadership ability at Lehigh University. She has clear goals, and creative
ideas, and careful planning. She had the ability to motivated other people to cooperate with her, and
together to accomplish a task, rather than did everything by herself. Her lid was high that our group was
the best among all the other groups. An opposite example I had was a small firm my mom used to work
for. It is a steel sales store with only four workers: a shopkeeper, an accountant, a cashier, and a
warehouse keeper. The shopkeeper was the owner of the store. He was a ridiculous person since he
kept telling his story, without ever listen to anyone else. Although he was a good seller and gave good
payroll to his employees, people gradually left him.

THE LAW OF INFLUENCE

The nonviolent and noncooperation movement was first proposed by Gandhi. While he was a lawyer in
South Africa, his motherland suffered from being a colony of England, so Gandhi decided to go to his
country. Gandhi started off his plan by saying through the speech “At this holy place, I declare, if you
want to protect your 'Hindu Dharma,' non-cooperation is first as well as the last lesson you must learn
up." India is a hierarchy society with strictly scheduled class. Starting a movement at as a complex
country can be extremely frustrated. Gandhi focused on expanding initiatives against untouchability,
alcoholism, ignorance, and poverty. He focused on solving the wedge between the Swaraj Party and the
Indian National Congress, the two biggest parties in India, instead focusing on resolving the wedge.
Gandhi was a beam of the limelight for most of the 1920s. In the preceding years, the British
government had appointed a new constitutional reform commission under Sir John Simon, which did
not include any Indian as its member. Indian political parties were enraged. They boycotted the
commission. However, Gandhi pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928
calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-
cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal. The British did not respond.
Therefore, Gandhi led thousands of Indian marching 388 kilometers in January 26th, 1930, without
eating. It was the most famous campaign in Indian history. The British, therefore, cut off the tax, as well
as imprisoned 60 thousand people. Gandhi was one of them. He could influence people to believe him
to be their leader.

THE LAW OF PROCESS

Has been in Korean pop music for five years, I saw the improvement within their musical industry. The
number of Kpop fans spring up recently. If one search for the K-pop reaction video on the Youtube,
there will be lots of videos coming up. Contrary, if one search for C-pop or J-pop, barely any relevant
videos. The number of followers reflects the success of Kpop. They make every aspect of their music
perfect. The music video of Korean pop music is the premium in the world. They always try to make MV
creative, refreshing, and also memorable. Their lives are also interactive and cheerful. Not only that,
every year each Korean boy groups and girl groups will release one album, not including members’ solo
album, which is impressing fruitful. All of their achievements are not unfounded. Kpop stars are the
most diligent people I know. Before debut, these young teenagers were trained at different
entertainment companies for four to five years. That is a painful period—endlessly practice singing,
dancing, and rapping while balancing normal school life at the same time. Only a few people will stand

out and become idols. Followed by that are fierce competitions artists, which forces them to practice for
the perfect outcome. Being an idol is not just about sleep deprivation, but also stress, tiredness,
pressure. It is the process that they experience all the way along, bring them the fame.

The two tables here show the frequency of switching among applications.
The primary finding is that schedulers switch among the three applications used most frequently.
This suggests that it would be advantageous to provide schedulers sufficient real estate on monitors to have at least three applications open concurrently in order to minimize the switching effort and time.

Quick Hit Recommendations
Larger monitors – 24” to 30” widescreen
Function of new system design and process, i.e, how many windows will be open concurrently
Headsets for telephones – hands free
Ergonomic mice and mouse pads
Best practice sharing – e.g., use of instant messaging with customers for more rapid response

[Just elaborate on above bullets in terms of benefits of the recommendations.  No, don’t elaborate, have something to say.  For example, ]
Larger monitors are desirable, particularly thinking forward to a windows-based replacement system
The larger monitors will be usable with the new system
Headsets for telephones will facilitate the use of the computer systems while speaking on the phone
Ergonomic mice and mouse pads. (pause) We recommend trying a variety of more ergonomic devices on a limited basis to determine individual preferences among the schedulers
Again, both the headsets and ergonomic devices will be usable with the new system
Best practice sharing.  We observed on scheduler using instant messaging to achieve faster turn around on communications

    "document_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "language": "en/de/es/..."
  }
  
  Validation rules:
  1. The tags array MUST contain at least one tag
  2. The correspondent MUST be a non-empty string
  3. The title MUST be a non-empty string
  4. The document_type MUST be a non-empty string
  5. The document_date MUST be in YYYY-MM-DD format
  6. The language MUST be a valid language code
  
  The custom_fields are optional and can be left out if not needed. Only fill out values if you find matching information in the document.
  Do not change the value of field_name, only fill out the values. If the field is about money only add the number without currency and always use a . for decimal places.

After gaining a basic understanding of the scheduling process, we characterized the scheduler’s work by collecting data.
The interaction between the schedulers and the scheduling system,
The frequency of use among the applications and activities,
The frequency of switching among the applications and activities, as well as
The scheduler’s time utilization among various applications and activities.

Findings -  As-Is Process
February 3, 2012

Please see separate document







An overview of the process was created to help us understand the work of the schedulers.  This flow chart is far from complete, but served our purpose and the scope of our project by documenting the basic concepts.  The referenced “separate document” is copied at the end of this narrative.

Findings – Frequency of Use

Lehigh University Enterprise Systems Center

February 3, 2012










Data was obtained by observing three different schedulers on three separate days.
The data indicates that CAS, Excel and e-mail/IM are the three applications primarily used and that CAS is the application used most frequently.
The “Other” category includes a variety of activities not specifically identified here, such as:
Conversing with other employees,
Printing and,
Away from desk.

Data Collection, Analysis and Findings
Lehigh University Enterprise Systems Center

February 3, 2012









Data was obtained by observing two different schedulers on two separate days.
The two tables here show the frequency of switching among applications.
The primary finding is that schedulers switch among the three applications used most frequently.
This suggests that it would be advantageous to provide schedulers sufficient real estate on monitors to have at least three applications open concurrently in order to minimize the switching effort and time.

February 3, 2012









Data was obtained by observing two different schedulers on two separate days.
The two pie charts show the percentage of time schedulers are engaged in various activities or using applications.
There are significant differences among schedulers in the methods used to do their work.
However, in general, the primary applications used by the schedulers are CAS and Excel.

Monitors
Larger monitors are desirable, particularly thinking forward to a windows-based replacement system
The larger monitors will be usable with the new system
Headsets for telephones will facilitate the use of the computer systems while speaking on the phone
Ergonomic mice and mouse pads.  We recommend trying a variety of more ergonomic devices on a limited basis to determine individual preferences among the schedulers
Again, both the headsets and ergonomic devices will be usable with the new system
Best practice sharing.   For example, we observed one scheduler using instant messaging to achieve faster turnaround on communications.

Project Next Steps
Workstation Ergonomics
Monitors
Other considerations


Lehigh University Enterprise Systems Center
21
February 3, 2012







Monitors
Size
As suggested in the Quick Hit Recommendations, larger monitor are appropriate
Size in the range of 24” to 30” widescreens is suggested – they allow more windows of a useful size to be open on the same monitor
Quantity
The amount of information an individual can handle at one time is limited
The new software should be more “intelligent” than CAS so that fewer windows at a time should be required
A single display should be the focus of a schedulers attention and contain the most vital information
A secondary display may still be useful for access to reference information and utility applications such as:
Calculations
Telephone interface
Other factors
A companion recommendation is the use of document holders, which will allow schedulers to view paper-based information at the same height level as the display
Use articulated display mounting devices to maximize adjustability
Other considerations
Flexibility
Work stations need to accommodate the full range of scheduler size and reach limitations
Primary features that need adjustability are chairs, the height of keyboards and mice, and the height of monitors
There may be some cases where ergonomic features such as footrests may be appropriate
Work area footprint
An additional benefit of articulated monitor mounts is maximizing the work area footprint at each workstation
A larger work area will enable a larger useable space when paper-based documents or work is required
Eye fatigue
Raise monitors to a comfortable level, which usually is a line of sight that is either straight ahead or slightly below eye level, but never above eye level
Adjustability of distance from the monitor(s), text size and screen contrast is desirable
Use glare screens, if needed
Input devices
Provide alternatives to the use of a mouse, such as arrow keys and the enter key, particularly for dialogue boxes
Provide shortcuts for common functions
Use of a Computer Workstation Self-Assessment – see example at the end of this narrative

Information disclosed by any party hereto to another party hereto before or after the date of this Agreement shall be
used only for the foregoing purpose and shall be maintained in secrecy and each party will use reasonable diligence
to prevent disclosure except to employees on a need-to-know basis who are aware of the requirements of this
Agreement. All information furnished directly or indirectly by one party to another, including without limitation all
non-public, confidential, privileged or proprietary information relating to the disclosing party’s business, all
materials furnished by one party to another, the fact that the Information has been made available, the subject
matter of the Information and the fact that the parties are conducting such discussions and/or have discontinued
such discussions, are included in the Information. The Information includes not only written information, but also
information stored or transmitted orally, visually, electronically or by any other means.

MERCK's and COMPANY’S obligations under this Agreement shall be limited to a period of five (5) years from
receipt of Information. MERCK and COMPANY shall not have any obligation of confidentiality with respect to
any information that:

1. is in the public domain by use and/or publication at the time of its receipt from the disclosing party; or

2. was already in its possession prior to receipt from the disclosing party or is developed independently of
Information received from the disclosing party; or

3. is properly obtained by recipient from a third party (i.e., not a party to this Confidentiality Agreement)
with a valid right to disclose such Information and such third party is not under a confidentiality
obligation to the disclosing party; or

4. is required to be disclosed by law, provided that the party seeking to disclose Information shall give
reasonable notice to the other party of such requirement prior to making any such disclosure such that
the other party can seek an appropriate protective order.

It is understood that the disclosure of Information under this Agreement does not confer to any party any right in or
to Information disclosed by another party.

Any and all Information received by any party from another, upon request, shall be promptly returned upon request,
except MERCK and COMPANY may each retain one copy of such Information in its files solely for archival
purposes.

parties. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is void or unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain
valid and enforceable.

It is understood and agreed by all parties that except for this Agreement and any prior confidentiality agreement,
any obligation between MERCK and COMPANY (or any combination of such parties) will come into existence
only by the execution and delivery of a formal written document signed by the parties to be bound by such
obligation. Any and all discussions and communications prior to the execution of such a document are preliminary
only and will not be legally binding on any party.

The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey. Any
action or proceeding brought to enforce or interpret this Agreement shall be brought in the State of New Jersey, and

action and that venue for any such action shall lie in the Federal and state courts of New Jersey. The parties waive
service of process and any objection to personal jurisdiction in such courts. The parties further stipulate and agree
that any violation of this Agreement shall result in immediate and irreparable harm for which an action at law for
money damages would provide an inadequate remedy, and accordingly, in the event of such violation a party may
seek injunctive relief in the state and Federal courts of New Jersey.

Date

Dear Dr. Zimmers,

This letter is to confirm that Company Name has given the Enterprise Systems Center the
authority to begin the Project Title, prior to approval of our BFTC proposal for this work.

We are aware that for some reason the proposal may not be approved and we will fund
the entire $ Project Amount, if necessary, with the understanding that the project can be
terminated at any point by Company Name. Company Name would only be liable for
payment of work completed at time of termination. Assuming it does get approved, it is
our understanding that any dollars we have spent to that date will receive matching credit
from Ben Franklin.

You also have our permission to invoice us for your costs on a monthly basis until the
contract is in force. After that time, you will invoice us quarterly, per your normal
practice.

Sincerely,



President

hereby agree as follows:

1. The Parties may disclose to each other information that it considers

Information concerning the disclosing party or the disclosing Parties’ clients

6. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in
exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other

laws of the State of Illinois, without regard for its conflicts of laws principles. The
terms of the Agreement may be modified or waived only by separate writing
signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.

Accomplishments versus last week’s goals:
· Our last weekly meeting we agreed that we had a good enough understanding of the data to begin analysis. We scheduled a work session where we began to create the necessary pivot tables for our analysis. The group continues to work on these tables to ensure that they represent relevant data for our requested analysis.
Next week’s goals:
· The group will time permitting set another work session this week so that we may have more pivot tables created to discuss and analyze during the weekly meeting

WHEREAS, in connection with ___________________________ (“Transaction”), the Parties may disclose valuable proprietary information to each other relating to their Transaction; and

WHEREAS, the Transaction may require the Parties to disclose confidential and proprietary information to each other; and

WHEREAS, Grant Thornton and Vendor wish to provide a mechanism for the protection of the confidentiality of the Parties’ confidential information;

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements hereinafter set forth the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1.

The Parties shall not use (other than in the relation to the Transaction) or disclose to others during or subsequent to the performance of this Agreement the Confidential Information, unless in each instance the receiving party secures the prior written consent of the disclosing party. The Parties shall take every such action with its employees and agents to effectuate the intent of this provision and the confidentiality obligation imposed by this Agreement.

2.	In consideration of disclosure of the Confidential Information to the receiving party, the receiving party agrees:

The Parties agree that in such case the receiving party will promptly destroy all Confidential Information (with such destruction to be certified to the disclosing party) or return such information to the disclosing upon its request. No such termination or destruction of the Confidential Information will affect or terminate the Parties’ obligations under this Agreement, which obligations will continue in effect for the term specified below.

6.	It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement.

7.	This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard for its conflicts of laws principles. The terms of the Agreement may be modified or waived only by separate writing signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.

8.	This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties with respect to Confidential Information and supersedes all other oral or written representations, agreements or communications with respect to Confidential Information. 

9. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party, and neither party shall delegate its
duties hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party. All of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns.

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
This Agreement effective as of  between Merck & Co., Inc., with an address of One Merck Drive, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey 08889-0100 (hereinafter referred to as "MERCK"), and  Raymond  Novotny    with an address of 132 Rt 109,Cape May, NJ 08204 (hereinafter referred to as “COMPANY"”) confirms the terms under which MERCK and COMPANY will exchange non-public, confidential, privileged or proprietary information and materials (hereinafter referred to as "Information"),  for the sole purpose of reviewing a project relating to cost estimates of refrigeration units for storing vaccines..  MERCK and COMPANY, each agree that any Information disclosed by any party hereto to another party hereto before or after the date of this Agreement shall be used only for the foregoing purpose and shall be maintained in secrecy and each party will use reasonable diligence to prevent disclosure except to employees on a need-to-know basis who are aware of the requirements of this Agreement. All information furnished directly or indirectly by one party to another, including without limitation all non-public, confidential, privileged or proprietary information relating to the disclosing party’s business, all materials furnished by one party to another, the fact that the Information has been made available, the subject matter of the Information and the fact that the parties are conducting such discussions and/or have discontinued such discussions, are included in the Information. The Information includes not only written information, but also information stored or transmitted orally, visually, electronically or by any other means. 

MERCK's and COMPANY’S obligations under this Agreement shall be limited to a period of five (5) years from receipt of Information.  MERCK and COMPANY shall not have any obligation of confidentiality with respect to any information that:


1.
is in the public domain by use and/or publication at the time of its receipt from the disclosing party; or


2.
was already in its possession prior to receipt from the disclosing party or is developed independently of Information received from the disclosing party; or


3.
is properly obtained by recipient from a third party (i.e., not a party to this Confidentiality Agreement) with a valid right to disclose such Information and such third party is not under a confidentiality obligation to the disclosing party; or


4.
is required to be disclosed by law, provided that the party seeking to disclose Information shall give reasonable notice to the other party of such requirement prior to making any such disclosure such that the other party can seek an appropriate protective order.

It is understood that the disclosure of Information under this Agreement does not confer to any party any right in or to Information disclosed by another party.

Any and all Information received by any party from another, upon request, shall be promptly returned upon request, except MERCK and COMPANY may each retain one copy of such Information in its files solely for archival purposes.

All previous confidentiality agreements between the parties hereto shall remain in full force and effect, and in the event of any conflict between confidentiality agreements the agreement providing for stricter confidentiality shall control.  No modification or alteration of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement is void or unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain valid and enforceable.

It is understood and agreed by all parties that except for this Agreement and any prior confidentiality agreement, any obligation between MERCK and COMPANY (or any combination of such parties) will come into existence only by the execution and delivery of a formal written document signed by the parties to be bound by such obligation.  Any and all discussions and communications prior to the execution of such a document are preliminary only and will not be legally binding on any party.

The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey. Any action or proceeding brought to enforce or interpret this Agreement shall be brought in the State of New Jersey, and the parties stipulate and agree that the state and Federal courts of New Jersey shall have jurisdiction of any such action and that venue for any such action shall lie in the Federal and state courts of New Jersey. The parties waive service of process and any objection to personal jurisdiction in such courts.  The parties further stipulate and agree that any violation of this Agreement shall result in immediate and irreparable harm for which an action at law for money damages would provide an inadequate remedy, and accordingly, in the event of such violation a party may seek injunctive relief in the state and Federal courts of New Jersey.

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
This Agreement effective as of  between Merck & Co., Inc., with an address of One Merck Drive, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey 08889-0100 (hereinafter referred to as "MERCK"), and Daniel B. Mulholland with an address of 3100 South Ocean Blvd 204s, Palm Beach, FL  33480  (hereinafter referred to as “COMPANY"”) confirms the terms under which MERCK and COMPANY will exchange non-public, confidential, privileged or proprietary information and materials (hereinafter referred to as "Information"),  for the sole purpose of reviewing a project relating to cost estimates of refrigeration units for storing vaccines..  MERCK and COMPANY, each agree that any Information disclosed by any party hereto to another party hereto before or after the date of this Agreement shall be used only for the foregoing purpose and shall be maintained in secrecy and each party will use reasonable diligence to prevent disclosure except to employees on a need-to-know basis who are aware of the requirements of this Agreement. All information furnished directly or indirectly by one party to another, including without limitation all non-public, confidential, privileged or proprietary information relating to the disclosing party’s business, all materials furnished by one party to another, the fact that the Information has been made available, the subject matter of the Information and the fact that the parties are conducting such discussions and/or have discontinued such discussions, are included in the Information. The Information includes not only written information, but also information stored or transmitted orally, visually, electronically or by any other means. 

MERCK's and COMPANY’S obligations under this Agreement shall be limited to a period of five (5) years from receipt of Information.  MERCK and COMPANY shall not have any obligation of confidentiality with respect to any information that:


1.
is in the public domain by use and/or publication at the time of its receipt from the disclosing party; or


2.
was already in its possession prior to receipt from the disclosing party or is developed independently of Information received from the disclosing party; or


3.
is properly obtained by recipient from a third party (i.e., not a party to this Confidentiality Agreement) with a valid right to disclose such Information and such third party is not under a confidentiality obligation to the disclosing party; or


4.
is required to be disclosed by law, provided that the party seeking to disclose Information shall give reasonable notice to the other party of such requirement prior to making any such disclosure such that the other party can seek an appropriate protective order.

It is understood that the disclosure of Information under this Agreement does not confer to any party any right in or to Information disclosed by another party.

Any and all Information received by any party from another, upon request, shall be promptly returned upon request, except MERCK and COMPANY may each retain one copy of such Information in its files solely for archival purposes.

All previous confidentiality agreements between the parties hereto shall remain in full force and effect, and in the event of any conflict between confidentiality agreements the agreement providing for stricter confidentiality shall control.  No modification or alteration of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement is void or unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain valid and enforceable.

It is understood and agreed by all parties that except for this Agreement and any prior confidentiality agreement, any obligation between MERCK and COMPANY (or any combination of such parties) will come into existence only by the execution and delivery of a formal written document signed by the parties to be bound by such obligation.  Any and all discussions and communications prior to the execution of such a document are preliminary only and will not be legally binding on any party.

The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey. Any action or proceeding brought to enforce or interpret this Agreement shall be brought in the State of New Jersey, and the parties stipulate and agree that the state and Federal courts of New Jersey shall have jurisdiction of any such action and that venue for any such action shall lie in the Federal and state courts of New Jersey. The parties waive service of process and any objection to personal jurisdiction in such courts.  The parties further stipulate and agree that any violation of this Agreement shall result in immediate and irreparable harm for which an action at law for money damages would provide an inadequate remedy, and accordingly, in the event of such violation a party may seek injunctive relief in the state and Federal courts of New Jersey.

Chapter 7: Technology Accelerators

Summary: 
 A lot of “good” companies have this huge misconception that new technology will be creator in making their company “great.” However, the truth is that new technology, when used right, serves as an accelerator of momentum. Good-to-great companies don’t begin transitions with pioneering technology, but they analyze how exactly pioneering technology relates to their Hedgehog Concept.

Main Points

· The concept of technology-induced change is nothing new. What is new is the new role that the new technology will play in the business setting.

· It’s hard to properly use new technology if you do not stay within the three circles of the Hedgehog Concept.

· Good to Great companies avoid technology fads or begin transformation with the new technology. They instead use the application of the technology to accelerate their change. 

· 80% of the good-to-great executives did not even mention technology as one of the top five factors in their transition. Technology itself isn’t a primary cause of either greatness or decline. 

· Those who build mediocrity through technology are motivated by fear of being left behind. Those who turn great are motivated by the creative urge to strive for excellence.
